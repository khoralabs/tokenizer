/**
 * Computes weighted PageRank scores for nodes.
 *
 * PageRank assigns each node a score representing its global importance
 * within the graph based on the weight and structure of incoming links.
 *
 * This implementation uses a weighted transition model:
 *
 *    PR(to) = (1 - α)/N + α * Σ[ PR(from) * (w(from→to) / Σ(w(from→*)) ) ]
 *
 * where:
 *   - α (alpha) is the damping factor (typically 0.85),
 *   - N is the total number of nodes,
 *   - w(from→to) is the weight of the transition from `from` to `to`,
 *   - Σ(w(from→*)) is the total outgoing weight from node `from`.
 *
 * The algorithm iteratively updates PageRank values over `iters` steps.
 * After convergence, the scores are normalized so the highest-ranked node
 * has a hubScore of 1.
 *
 * @param iters - Number of iterations (default 15)
 * @param alpha - Damping factor (default 0.85)
